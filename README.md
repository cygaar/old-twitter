## About

Don't like the Twitter rebrand to x.com? Neither did I, so I made this Chrome extension that lets you revert x-branding back to the beloved bird.

The loading icon still needs to be replaced.

## Installation

Right now this extension is not uploaded to the Chrome web store. That may change later on.

In order to use this extension, you can load these files in as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
